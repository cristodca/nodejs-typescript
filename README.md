# NodeJS with JS or Typescript

## Clone the repository
You can clone the repository using HTTPS or downloading the .zip file.

## Run on development
In order to test the code and edit it, you will need to install the dependecies, there is a few of them (_ts-node_,_typescript_) but you can **install all** of them by running:

`npm install`

When the installation process have finished your code will be ready to be tested and changed.

The code should do the same on JS and Typescript (that's how I practice TS because I already know JS very well).

You can **run JS code** by executing the following command:

`node {filename}.js`

If you want to **run Typescript code** you will need this command:

`ts-node {filename}.ts`

## Thank you!

And that's all for the moment, thank you for your time. If you like the project you can give me a star.
